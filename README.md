# Identifying Behaviour Patterns using Machine Learning Techniques [Video]
This is the code repository for [Identifying Behaviour Patterns using Machine Learning Techniques [Video]](https://www.packtpub.com/big-data-and-business-intelligence/identifying-behaviour-patterns-using-machine-learning-techniques-?utm_source=github&utm_medium=repository&utm_campaign=9781788621885), published by [Packt](https://www.packtpub.com/?utm_source=github). It contains all the supporting project files necessary to work through the video course from start to finish.
## About the Video Course
Nowadays web-sites needs to handle huge amount of traffic. We can leverage that fact and capture user interactions with the application. For further analysis. Next, we can analyze users behavior and capture patterns on which we are able to react properly. 

In applications that needs to deal with huge amount of traffic it is very hard to detect anomalies. Weâ€™ll learn how to apply clustering to find anomalies in web traffic. Next, we can analyze users behaviour and when they tend to do on our application using time series data. We will be using GMM clustering technique to achieve that.

On the e-commerce sites we want to predict when and what user wants to buy in the future. We can use the Hidden markov Model to find transitions between states and find the transition with highest probability.
